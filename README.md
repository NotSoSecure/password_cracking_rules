# password_cracking_rule

This is a supporting repo for blog post https://www.notsosecure.com/one-rule-to-rule-them-all


“Our super rule came out on top in all our tests, as well as others we looked at after. We’re sorry to disappoint any Lord of the Rings fans (“One ring to rule them all!”), but despite our rule name, there likely won’t ever be one rule to rule them all as other rule based attacks wouldn’t exist if there was. Password attacks should always be executed factoring in all variables, in particular the available time, hardware resources, dictionary size and algorithm.”
